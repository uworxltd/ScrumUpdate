# Contributing to ScrumUpdate

Thanks for your interest! We're glad you're here. Contributions of all kinds are welcome — bug reports, docs, and pull requests.

## Issues

- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Use a clear, descriptive title and include steps to reproduce for bugs.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch (`feature/your-change`).
2. Keep changes focused and consistent with the surrounding code (see language conventions below).
3. Make sure the relevant tests and build pass locally.
4. Open a pull request describing what you changed and why.

### A note on review time

This project is maintained by a small team with **no dedicated governing body or full-time PR reviewers**. Reviewers are volunteers doing their best between their day-to-day work, so your PR may take a while to get attention. Please be patient and don't take it personally — we do review everything, just not always quickly. Ping us politely after a couple of weeks if there's been no movement.
